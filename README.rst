What's this?
============
This is a **friendly** command line tool for *user management tasks* in
Linux/Unix system, which including:

* ``list`` all users and/or groups in system
* ``create``/``remove`` a user and/or group in system
* ``show``/``change`` a user's information (including *sudoer* edit)
* ``manage`` users passwd info (e.g. the Aging of password)

And by **friendly**, it means this tool can not only help you accomplish
your task easily, but also inform you how the task is done verbosely or
interactively. The advantages are:

  tool directly instead of reading the lengthy and esoteric manual and
  forget afterward everytime.
* For novices of system admin tasks, this tool can also let them learn and
  understand clearly how user management work in Linux/Unix system.

  enjoy an unified command line interface.
